Our project is in the development category because it involves designing and building a working system that integrates hardware and software components. We are developing a real-time monitoring platform based on Digital Twin technology to gather data and provide insights to improve infant sleep quality. The project includes sensor integration, data analysis, and a mobile application interface.

Many parents struggle to understand why their baby wakes up during sleep. Since sleep is critical for a baby’s growth and development, it’s important to identify what affects it. Factors like room temperature, noise, humidity, or baby movement can impact sleep quality, but parents often don’t have the tools to track or analyze these things. Without this information, it’s hard to improve the baby’s sleep or know what changes to make.
